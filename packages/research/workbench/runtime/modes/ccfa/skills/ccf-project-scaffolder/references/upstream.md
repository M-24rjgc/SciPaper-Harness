# CCF Project Scaffolder

## Family File Contract

Before writing, resolve the canonical output and one stable working directory per task/artifact. Reuse explicit or established task paths; otherwise use project-root `ccfa-workfiles/<purpose>/<artifact-id>/`, with `source/`, `assets/`, `cache/`, and `build/` only as needed. Update current files in place; do not scatter intermediates or create iteration copies. Preserve inputs and required evidence; clean only verified disposable files created by this task. Use UTF-8 text I/O and check Chinese text after saving or rendering. For file work, apply [artifact-contracts.md](../ccf-common/references/artifact-contracts.md) and reuse the same paths across skill transitions.

## Collaboration Contract

Before specialist execution, read and apply [ccf-humanization](../ccf-humanization/SKILL.md) first, then [ccf-common](../ccf-common/SKILL.md). At every handoff, reuse their applicable active rules or refresh missing/changed ones. Both preflights are required even without prose; detailed editing, experiment, and maintenance modes run only when relevant.

Keep one integrating owner and actively use other skills to resolve missing prerequisites or check material findings. Reuse applicable evidence; do not skip necessary groundwork to save tokens. Before finalizing, integrate contributions and verify affected results. Follow the conditional [cooperation routes](../ccf-common/references/routing.md); avoid unrelated stages and duplicate reports.

## Invocation Controls

**CCFA Handoff Mode: PARTIAL (Recommended).** Follow `metadata.ccf_skill_controls.handoff_question_mode`, `../ccf-common/references/handoff-modes.md`, and `../ccf-common/references/task-modes.md`. A scaffold request authorizes the necessary local structure; a dry-run or no-new-files request limits changes accordingly.

## Core Rule

Create the requested project structure, template, and state without inventing research content. Preserve existing user files and complete compatible missing pieces instead of replacing an established project.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the project location, venue, requested folders, and existing artifacts from the conversation and filesystem. Infer routine directory names; ask only about a consequential unresolved location or overwrite choice.
2. Select the matching template through `../ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/index.md`. Verify that the template and its supporting style/assets are available. Use supplied templates when requested; identify unavailable dependencies precisely instead of copying an incomplete template.
3. Resolve final artifacts and the working root through `../ccf-common/references/artifact-contracts.md`. Create only needed directories and templates, with source/assets/cache/build subdirectories on demand. Preserve existing layout; do not migrate user files or overwrite a manuscript, bibliography, or configuration to refresh a scaffold.
4. If `ccfa.yaml` is absent and initialization is requested, copy `assets/ccfa.yaml`, preserve the required fields in `../ccf-common/references/ccfa-yaml-contract.md`, and fill only supplied project metadata. Existing state is read and updated only within the requested scope; unknown research fields remain explicit placeholders.
5. Check the created paths, template references, and YAML. A build is useful when a runnable template was requested and an engine is available; do not run research experiments or final submission checks for directory setup.
6. Report the actual created/updated paths and any concrete missing dependency. For a dry run, return the proposed tree and actions without writing files.

## Boundaries

Use `../ccf-common/references/artifact-contracts.md` for file ownership. Project workflow planning belongs to `ccf-pipeline-orchestrator`, manuscript prose to `ccf-paper-writer`, and final package checks to `ccf-submission-checker`. Do not invent a title, abstract, claim, experiment, or citation.
