# CCF Integrity Auditor

## Family File Contract

Before writing, resolve the canonical output and one stable working directory per task/artifact. Reuse explicit or established task paths; otherwise use project-root `ccfa-workfiles/<purpose>/<artifact-id>/`, with `source/`, `assets/`, `cache/`, and `build/` only as needed. Update current files in place; do not scatter intermediates or create iteration copies. Preserve inputs and required evidence; clean only verified disposable files created by this task. Use UTF-8 text I/O and check Chinese text after saving or rendering. For file work, apply [artifact-contracts.md](../ccf-common/references/artifact-contracts.md) and reuse the same paths across skill transitions.

## Collaboration Contract

Before specialist execution, read and apply [ccf-humanization](../ccf-humanization/SKILL.md) first, then [ccf-common](../ccf-common/SKILL.md). At every handoff, reuse their applicable active rules or refresh missing/changed ones. Both preflights are required even without prose; detailed editing, experiment, and maintenance modes run only when relevant.

Keep one integrating owner and actively use other skills to resolve missing prerequisites or check material findings. Reuse applicable evidence; do not skip necessary groundwork to save tokens. Before finalizing, integrate contributions and verify affected results. Follow the conditional [cooperation routes](../ccf-common/references/routing.md); avoid unrelated stages and duplicate reports.

## Core Rule

Trace each important claim to supplied evidence, each number to supplied results, and each citation to a real cited work and a supported citation context. Mark unsupported items instead of repairing them by invention.

## Modes

- `claim-audit`: claim-support and result-to-claim consistency.
- `numeric-audit`: numbers, units, table/figure/text agreement, deltas, and metric direction.
- `citation-audit`: already cited papers, BibTeX metadata, duplicate keys, DOI/arXiv/venue sanity, and citation-context support.
- `full`: all integrity checks.

## Workflow

1. Identify supplied manuscript, figures/tables/results, bibliography, `ccfa.yaml`, and requested audit mode.
2. Build a claim-evidence matrix and mark each claim as supported, partially supported, unsupported, overstated, or unclear.
3. Cross-check the reported values within the requested scope across text, tables, figures, captions, abstracts, and conclusions. Use deterministic arithmetic for deltas, units, metric direction, and rounding. Distinguish not comparable from inconsistent.
4. For citation audit, verify the identity and context support of existing citations through primary sources; metadata existence alone does not establish support. Batch independent identifiers when possible. Seek new literature only when requested; broad discovery belongs to `ccf-literature-searcher`.
5. For any questionable citation, separate metadata problems from context-support problems.
6. Hand off to `ccf-paper-reviewer` for full scientific judgment and to `ccf-paper-writer` for safe wording edits.
7. If the numbers and claims are consistent but the figure/table layout, caption placement, palette, float order, or rendered readability is weak, hand off to `ccf-visual-composer`.

## Execution Boundaries

Follow `../ccf-common/references/handoff-modes.md`, `../ccf-common/references/task-modes.md`, and `../ccf-common/references/privacy-and-evidence.md`. Finish the checkable portions when an attachment or source is missing. Report exact file/page/table locations, affected values or claims, evidence, and severity; mark unverified coverage separately from failures. An audit request does not authorize manuscript rewriting. Use existing authorization for explicitly requested fixes and preserve raw measurements.
