name: ts-paper-figure
description: >
  Stage 6 of the ts-paper suite. Fill a Traitement du Signal paper's figure placeholders with real
  diagrams. Claude DESIGNS a concrete, rich figure and GROUNDS it on a real on-topic top/mid-journal MAIN
  figure (Claude **WebSearches** for it, then `fetch_reference_figures.py` pulls that paper's MAIN figure,
  passed to the image model as an image-condition — grounding is MANDATORY, no silent skip); the render
  comes from the **official PaperBanana** pipeline (`ts-figure-svg/scripts/setup_paperbanana.py`, its own
  Retriever→Planner→Stylist→Visualizer→Critic) or, unconfigured, the built-in `gen_image.py`; Claude then
  LOOKS at the PNG with its own vision and critiques/refines it over ≥2 ENFORCED rounds. The approved PNG
  is then **redrawn as a native editable SVG by ts-figure-svg** — its design language learned, its content
  re-derived from the paper, audited and repaired over ≥4 measured rounds (never a pixel trace); if that is
  impossible the ts-figure-optimize DrawAI HYBRID or the approved PNG is kept — never a lossy redraw, PNG
  always kept. Engine is routed by SECTION: only real measured-data results plots (data-aware mode, results
  section) use matplotlib; EVERY other figure — architecture/pipeline/concept/math-geometry/schematic — is
  image-model rendered (so in proposal mode every figure is image-model). In proposal mode quantitative
  results plots are SKIPPED (no real data — drawing one fabricates results).
  Use to turn the empty \fbox placeholders into publication-quality figures.

# ts-paper-figure — figures: PaperBanana renders it, ts-figure-svg makes it a real figure

PaperBanana makes good academic figures with a team of LLM agents (Retriever → Planner → Stylist →
Visualizer → **Critic**) running a **critique-and-refine loop**. Two ways to drive it here:

- **Preferred — the official pipeline.** `python3 ../ts-figure-svg/scripts/setup_paperbanana.py` pulls
  **dwzhu-pku/PaperBanana** and you call its own `skill/run.py` (step 3). Upstream code, upstream agents.
- **Fallback — the distilled loop.** With no PaperBanana key configured, every step except drawing pixels
  is LLM reasoning + **vision**, which Claude does natively: Claude is the Planner/Stylist/Critic and one
  tiny script (`gen_image.py`) is the Visualizer.

Either way the PNG is **not the deliverable** — it is the design target. Step 5b redraws it as a native,
editable, audited SVG (**ts-figure-svg**), because a render's labels are pixels and a paper figure's must
not be.

**Three things make this a SKILL and not just "Claude drawing a flowchart" — NEVER skip them:**
**(C1) DESIGN a concrete, rich visual blueprint** (step 2) instead of an abstract box list;
**(C2) GROUND every free-form figure in a real on-topic MAIN journal figure** (step 2b) — Claude
**WebSearches** for a TOP/MID-venue on-topic paper, fetches its MAIN figure, and passes it as an
image-condition (`/images/edits`) **plus** convention guidance — **mandatory, gate-enforced, no silent
skip**; **(C3) ENFORCE a logged multi-round vision critique** (steps 4–5, gated). The default
aesthetic is **rich & concrete** (real imagery, layered tensors, coordinated panels) — **never a flat
thin-line flowchart**. (Without C1–C3 the figures regress to the sparse boxes-and-arrows this redesign
fixed.)

## The only code: `scripts/gen_image.py`
It does one thing — send a prompt to an external image model, save a PNG. Configure the image model only:
```
export TS_FIG_MODEL="gpt-image-2"          # ← the image model (default gpt-image-2); from the repo .env
export TS_FIG_API_KEY="<image api key>"
export TS_FIG_BASE_URL="<openai-compatible base>"  # e.g. https://api.openai.com/v1
export TS_FIG_API_STYLE="images"           # or "chat" for nano-banana-style gateways
export TS_FIG_SIZE="1536x1024"             # QUALITY: landscape, mirrors the product's default (not 1024x1024)
export TS_FIG_QUALITY="high"               # gpt-image-* quality knob (the product used "high")
```

> **⛔ MODEL POLICY — do NOT pick a model yourself.** The image model is whatever **`TS_FIG_MODEL`** says
> (set in the repo-root `.env`; default **`gpt-image-2`**). **Never substitute, downgrade, or guess a model**
> (e.g. do NOT fall back to `gpt-image-1`), and never improvise the key (use `TS_FIG_API_KEY`, not
> `OPENAI_API_KEY`). If `TS_FIG_MODEL`/`TS_FIG_API_KEY`/`TS_FIG_BASE_URL` are unset, `gen_image.py` returns
> `unset env: …` — **STOP and ask the user to set them in `.env`**; do not export a model of your own choice.
Note: `TS_FIG_SIZE`/`TS_FIG_QUALITY` take effect only in images API style (`TS_FIG_QUALITY` only for
`gpt-image-*` models); in chat style the gateway controls resolution, so verify the render size in the
critique loop and re-render if crude.
(scaffold in `scripts/figure_config.example.sh` — copy to `figure_config.sh`, fill, `source` it.)
Text planning and critique need **no** config — they are Claude. **Quality matters:** render at
`1536x1024` `quality=high` (the defaults above), give a detailed prompt, and do a real refine pass —
a 1024×1024 low-effort render looks crude.

## Two figure engines, routed by SECTION (matplotlib only for results-section data plots)
The engine is decided by **which section the figure lives in**, NOT by its `type` — because matplotlib
only looks good for real-data plots and renders concept/schematic figures poorly (the "ugly matplotlib
figure" complaint this routing fixes):
- **matplotlib — ONLY for a real measured-data results plot in the results/experiments section**
  (`../ts-paper-data/scripts/plot_results.py --script`, figures4papers house style auto-applied — see
  `ts-paper-data/references/plot-style.md`). This is the one place exact-from-values plotting is needed:
  a results bar/line/heatmap/radar built from real numbers in `results.facts.json`, so **only in
  `data_aware` mode**. **Born vector:** the plot script MUST end with `finalize(fig, OUT)` and MUST NOT
  call `plt.savefig()` itself — `finalize` writes the PNG **and** a vector `figures/<label>.pdf` (editable
  text via `svg.fonttype=none`). In `proposal` mode there are no real numbers, so a results plot must NOT
  exist — if one slipped through, remove the float (never leave a blank `\fbox`, never fabricate/stub).
  Removing such a float does NOT violate the no-blanks rule: a results placeholder is illegitimate in
  proposal mode and should never have been emitted, so never render a substitute.
- **image model — EVERY OTHER figure, in every other section** (`gen_image.py` + GROUND + the
  vision-critique loop below): architecture / pipeline / framework / flow diagrams, qualitative scenes,
  icon schematics, **AND every concept / math-geometry illustration** (a distribution, manifold,
  trajectory, loss-curve shape, 3D geometry). These used to go to matplotlib and came out ugly — they
  are now DESIGNED + GROUNDED + image-model-rendered + ≥2-round vision-critiqued. (A concept illustration
  makes no real-metric claim and is grounding-OPTIONAL — ground it on a clean on-topic concept figure if
  one exists, else treat it like a qualitative scene.) After the PNG is approved, it is **redrawn as a
  native editable SVG** by the sibling **ts-figure-svg** skill (step 5b — design language learned from the
  render, content re-derived from the paper, ≥4 audited repair rounds, no key needed). Fall back to
  ts-figure-optimize's DrawAI HYBRID, then to keeping the PNG.
  - **🔴 HARD RULE — the redraw is DOWNSTREAM of generation, never instead of it.** A free-form figure is
    ALWAYS produced by the image model first (steps 2→2b→3→4: rich DESIGN + GROUND on a top-journal MAIN
    figure + render + ≥2 critique rounds). **You must NEVER hand-author an SVG straight from the text with
    no render** — that yields exactly the flat boxes-and-arrows regression this design removes, a HARD
    violation. The manifest `engine` of a free-form figure is always `image-model` or `paperbanana` (never
    `svg-native`); `check_figure_critique` FAILS the build otherwise. Step 5b's SVG is a *redraw of an
    approved render*, recorded as `svg_redraw` alongside that engine — a different thing entirely.
  - **If the image MODEL itself is unconfigured** (`gen_image.py` returns `unset env: TS_FIG_*`): this is a
    CREDENTIAL gap, handled at the orchestrator **Preflight** — **ASK the user whether to generate figures**
    (it needs `TS_FIG_API_KEY` / `TS_FIG_BASE_URL` / `TS_FIG_MODEL`, e.g. gpt-image-2). If they decline →
    **skip the free-form figures** (leave their placeholders, note in `logs/6_figure.io.md`); matplotlib
    results/concept plots still run (no key). **Never** substitute a hand-drawn diagram or improvise a key.

This unifies the suite's two figure-craft sources — **figures4papers (matplotlib)** for results-section
data plots, **PaperBanana (image model)** for everything else. **NET: in `data_aware` mode only the
results-section data plots are matplotlib; every other figure is image-model. In `proposal` mode there
are no data plots, so EVERY figure is image-model.** The figure floor (`figures.min`) is met by both kinds, and
**every placeholder ends rendered — no blanks. Both engines then end on an editable VECTOR PDF**:
every figure ends as `figures/<label>.pdf` (the embedded vector), with the original
`figures/<label>.png` and its source (`.plot.py` for matplotlib, `.svg` for a redrawn figure) kept
alongside. matplotlib is born-vector; an image-model raster becomes a **native SVG via ts-figure-svg**
(design language learned, content redrawn from the paper, audited) — falling back to ts-figure-optimize's
DrawAI HYBRID, then to keeping the approved PNG. No path may reduce the figure's quality.

## Procedure — the distilled Planner→render→Critic→refine→insert loop
Run after review (stage 5), before latex (stage 7). For EACH `\begin{figure}` placeholder in
`sections/*.tex` that still has an `\fbox{\rule…}` (no `\includegraphics` yet):

1. **Classify + route by SECTION (Critic's first job).** Read `%% FIGURE-SPEC type=…`, `%% DESC:`, the
   caption, and **which section the placeholder is in**, then pick the engine:
   - **Real-data results plot, in the results/experiments section (`data_aware` only):** write a
     self-contained matplotlib script `figures/<label>.plot.py` embedding the real numbers **from
     `results.facts.json`** (grouped_bar for the main comparison, line for a sweep, bar for ablation
     deltas), run `python3 ../ts-paper-data/scripts/plot_results.py --script figures/<label>.plot.py --out figures/<label>.png`,
     then **`Read` the PNG** to vision-check (labels legible, no clipped bars, right metric), fix the
     script if needed, then go to **step 6 (Insert)**. `proposal` mode → remove the float (no data). This
     is the ONLY matplotlib path.
   - **EVERY other figure** — architecture/pipeline/framework/flow schematic, qualitative scene, AND any
     concept / math-geometry illustration (distribution, manifold, trajectory, loss-curve shape, 3D shape):
     continue to **step 2** (the `gen_image.py` Planner→render→Critic→refine loop). A concept/math-geometry
     figure is illustrative (no real-metric claim) and grounding-OPTIONAL, but is still IMAGE-MODEL — never
     matplotlib (`check_figure_critique` FAILS a matplotlib figure outside the results section).
   The image-model path always runs the vision-critique loop. Either way, no placeholder is left blank.
2. **DESIGN the figure, then write the prompt (Planner + Stylist).** Adopt the lens of a *Lead Visual
   Designer for a top-tier venue (NeurIPS/CVPR/TGRS)*. FIRST sketch a concrete VISUAL BLUEPRINT (in your
   reasoning): for each position in the figure decide WHAT concrete thing appears — real imagery, a
   data/result panel, a layered-tensor network block, a depicted icon — **not just a labelled box** — and
   wire the data flow from the equations (below). THEN write a single, self-contained image-generation
   prompt that realises that blueprint and is **as detailed and concrete as possible — vague/abstract
   specs are the #1 cause of thin flowchart output**:
   - **Semantics:** name **every** box/module and **every** connection/arrow, in the order the method
     presents them; group related blocks; show the real data-flow direction. **Use the paper's own
     terminology verbatim** for each label (correct, fully spelled — garbled labels are the #1 AI-figure failure).
   - **Wire it from the equations (architecture/method/overview/pipeline/framework figures).** Before
     writing the prompt, build the **edge list from the math**: for every output/intermediate symbol the
     figure will show, find the equation whose **left-hand side defines** it and record `source-module →
     symbol`. The prompt must wire **each output from the single module that defines it** — e.g. "arrow
     from *ML+LLM anomaly detection* to chip *Anomaly score s*" because `s = σ(…)` is that module's
     equation — **never a detached output column where all outputs hang off the whole stack**. Include
     **every** module named in the FIGURE-SPEC `DESC`. (This is the born-from-text analogue of DrawAI's
     box-IR geometry constraint; its ground truth is the equations.)
   - **Conciseness (signal-to-noise):** boxes hold **short keywords/conceptual blocks**, NOT full
     sentences (>15 words) and NOT raw equations — a diagram is a visual abstraction, not box-ified text.
     (Full-sentence text is allowed only when it's an illustrative *data example*, e.g. a sample input.)
   - **Form — rich & concrete (publication-grade), NOT a flat flowchart.** Depict concrete visual
     content, not abstract boxes: **real photographic / data imagery** exactly where the method consumes
     or produces it (satellite tiles, segmentation masks, change maps, sample inputs/outputs); network
     blocks as **layered feature-map tensor slabs with gentle depth**; **multiple coordinated panels**; a
     clear left-to-right data flow; a refined, harmonious palette with **real visual hierarchy and depth**.
     Aim for the density and authority of a MAIN figure in a top-venue paper (the GROUND reference in
     step 2b sets the bar). Keep only these HARD constraints: a clean (white or lightly-toned) background;
     legible, correctly-spelled labels; the figure fits a LaTeX rectangle (no protruding bits/dead
     corners); no watermark and no draw.io-style background grid. **Avoid** flat thin-line box-and-arrow
     flowcharts, sparse single-colour diagrams, and "box-ified text".
   - **Icon semantics:** if the method implies conventional icons, keep their meaning (snowflake =
     frozen/non-trainable, flame = trainable); don't invent or garble them.
   - **Keep out of the image:** the figure caption / "Figure N:" title text, and any redundant text legend.
   - **No numbers** that would imply real results.
   Save it to `figures/<label>.prompt.txt` (so the trace shows what was asked).
2b. **GROUND on a real on-topic MAIN figure — MANDATORY, via your own search (the richness/authority core).**
   Every free-form schematic MUST be grounded on the **MAIN / hero / overall-method figure of an on-topic
   TOP-venue paper** (MID venue only if, after genuinely searching, no top-venue match exists). Use the
   SAME literature-search capability the cite stage uses — **YOU (Claude) actively `WebSearch`**; do NOT
   depend on any pre-existing file:
   1. **Search (`WebSearch`).** Query for the most relevant on-topic paper whose MAIN figure matches THIS
      figure's TYPE (architecture ↔ a paper's main architecture figure; concept ↔ a clean on-topic concept
      figure). Build queries from the paper's domain + this figure's subject (+ "architecture"/"framework"/
      "overview"/"arxiv"). If `<workdir>/retrieved_papers.json` happens to exist (upstream story stage), use
      it as a SEED — but never as the only source, and never assume it exists.
   2. **Confirm venue tier + relevance, then fetch the MAIN figure.** For the top hits, confirm the venue is
      **TOP** (or MID) and the topic genuinely matches. Write your chosen candidate(s) as
      `[{"title","venue","arxiv_url"}]` to `figures/refs/<label>.papers.json` and run
      `python3 scripts/fetch_reference_figures.py --papers figures/refs/<label>.papers.json --out-dir figures/refs --label <label>`
      (or `--arxiv <id> --venue "<venue>"` for a single clear winner). It reports `best_tier` + a **`search_again`** flag.
   3. **If `search_again` is true** (best candidate is not top/mid venue, or none came back) **OR the fetched
      figures are off-topic / minor (not a MAIN overview figure) → go back to step 1 and SEARCH AGAIN** with
      refined queries (different venue, broader/narrower terms). **Do NOT settle** for a low-tier or loosely
      related paper, and **do NOT skip grounding.**
   4. **`Read` the fetched candidates** (`figures/refs/<label>.candidates.json` + the images) and SELECT the
      single best **MAIN / hero / overall-method-overview** figure matching THIS figure's type. **Reject
      scattered minor figures** (results / ablation / qualitative / curves / insets / sample-grids /
      receptive-field / attention maps are NOT references).
   When you pick one: **distil its visual conventions** (how the field draws inputs / tensors / modules /
   outputs) INTO the step-2 prompt, AND **pass it as the render image-condition** (step 3 `--reference`).
   The reference guides CONVENTIONS and richness only — **never copy its content / text / labels / results.**
   Record the chosen paper (arxiv id + venue tier + fig no) in the manifest `reference_used` and set
   `grounding` to `image-cond` (or `vision-distill`).
   **🔴 NO graceful skip — grounding is NOT optional.** `check_figure_critique` FAILS a free-form schematic
   whose `grounding`/`reference_used` is `none`. If, after a GENUINE multi-query search (log the queries you
   tried), a top/mid-venue on-topic MAIN figure truly cannot be found (rare), **STOP and tell the user** —
   never silently render flat-and-ungrounded. (Skip 2b only for matplotlib / results figures.)
3. **Render (Visualizer).** **Prefer the official PaperBanana** when it is provisioned
   (`python3 ../ts-figure-svg/scripts/setup_paperbanana.py --check-only` says `ready`):
   ```
   python3 ../ts-figure-svg/engine/PaperBanana/skill/run.py \
     --content-file figures/<label>.prompt.txt --caption "<caption intent>" \
     --task diagram --aspect-ratio 3:2 --num-candidates 3 --max-critic-rounds 3 \
     --retrieval-setting random --exp-mode demo_full --output figures/<label>.png
   ```
   `--retrieval-setting random`, **never `none`** — PaperBanana is reference-driven, and with `none` it
   skips the reference set entirely and every figure comes back as the same pale box-and-arrow pipeline
   (this flag alone ruined a whole batch). With N>1 it writes `<label>_0.png`, `_1.png`, … — `Read` all of
   them and pick on **scientific correctness → hierarchy → column-width readability → tidiness → beauty**,
   recording why the losers lost. Budget ~40 min per figure at 3 candidates × 3 critic rounds.
   A run whose critic round errored is **incomplete, not passed** — and it fails *silently*: an exhausted
   retry chain prints `All 5 attempts failed…` and then `[Critic Round 1] No changes needed`, exits 0, and
   writes a plausible PNG. Grep the log for that pair. PNGs on disk prove nothing.
   On repeated 504s, retry with **identical** parameters ≤3× then mark the figure blocked — never raise
   concurrency, swap models, or cut candidates to force a pass.
   Otherwise use the built-in Visualizer:
   `python3 scripts/gen_image.py --prompt-file figures/<label>.prompt.txt --out figures/<label>.png [--reference figures/refs/<chosen>.png]`
   With a `--reference` on a gpt-image images-style endpoint, `gen_image.py` GROUNDS the render via
   `/images/edits` (image-condition) and reports `"path":"edits"`; with no reference or on any edits
   failure it automatically falls back to text→image (`"path":"generations"`). Either way the rich
   step-2 prompt drives the content.
4. **Critique with your own eyes (Critic — the quality core).** **`Read` the produced `figures/<label>.png`**
   and judge it on PaperBanana's four dimensions; each has hard **red-lines** — any red-line = fail, fix it:
   - **Faithfulness** (most important): matches the Method + Caption; **no hallucinated** modules/connections;
     no reversed or missing data-flow; stays within the caption's scope; **no gibberish/garbled labels or
     broken-LaTeX text** in boxes/arrows. (Smart simplification is fine — simpler ≠ less faithful.)
   - **Semantic faithfulness vs the EQUATIONS (architecture/method/overview/pipeline/framework figures —
     not just spelling/layout):** cross-check the figure against the math, not just against itself.
     Enumerate **every symbol shown** (outputs + intermediates); for each, confirm with your eyes that the
     **incoming arrow leaves the module whose equation DEFINES that symbol** (e.g. `s` must come from the
     anomaly-detection module per `s = σ(…)`, `Q` from the aggregation module, etc.). A symbol sourced
     from the wrong module / the whole stack / a detached column = **red-line**; a module named in the
     method/DESC but **missing** from the figure = red-line. Fix in this same loop and re-render.
   - **Conciseness:** a visual abstraction, not a text dump — red-line if boxes are full sentences (>15 words,
     unless a data example) or crammed with raw equations, or it's a "box-ified" copy of the text.
   - **Readability:** clear flow at a glance — red-line on the caption/"Figure N:" text rendered *inside*
     the image, overlapping/occluded labels, spaghetti arrow crossings, illegible/inconsistent font size,
     low contrast, a non-rectangular layout with dead corners, or a black background.
   - **Aesthetics:** publication polish — red-line on draw.io grids, pixelation/blur/distortion, neon or
     clashing colours, or mixed/misaligned fonts. (Rich, depicted, photographic, non-flat styling is
     GOOD — never red-line a figure for being detailed or realistic.)
   - **Richness / density (publication-grade) — the de-flat dimension:** the figure must show CONCRETE
     content (real imagery / data panels / layered tensors / depicted modules), multiple coordinated
     elements, and clear visual hierarchy — **red-line a thin, sparse box-and-arrow flowchart.** If it
     reads as a generic flowchart, name what to ADD (real imagery where the method touches data, tensor
     detail in the blocks, coordinated panels, denser correct labelling, stronger hierarchy) and
     re-render. Use the step-2b GROUND reference's density as the bar to clear.
   - **Integrity:** no fabricated numbers/results depicted; the GROUND reference informs CONVENTIONS only,
     never copied content/text/results.
5. **Refine (loop) — at least 2 rounds, the product ran 3.** "No red-line" ≠ "as good as it gets": a
   render can be red-line-free yet **crude** (sparse, generic, weak hierarchy, thin labelling). So do NOT
   accept round 1 just because nothing failed — run **at least one genuine improvement pass**: name what
   would make it more *publication-grade* (denser/clearer labels, stronger visual hierarchy, tighter
   layout, better use of the canvas, more faithful detail) and re-render. Repeat **up to 3 rounds**
   (PaperBanana's `max_critic_rounds`); accept early **only when the render is genuinely polished**, not
   merely red-line-free. Keep the best version; never ship a garbled or crude figure — if it's still weak
   after 3 rounds, ship the best and note the residual issue in the log.
   **Prove each "improvement" is real (no phantom v2):** write each round to a DISTINCT file
   (`<label>_vN.png`) and, before you claim a round improved anything, confirm the new render is **not
   byte-identical** to the prior (`md5sum`/`cmp`) **and** that your own vision sees the named change. If
   the re-render came back identical, it is **not** a new version — re-issue the edit or log "round N:
   no change, kept v(N-1)"; **never narrate an improvement that did not happen.** The log records the
   **observed** diff (what changed between renders), not the requested prompt edit; delete discarded
   intermediates so no stray `_vN.png` lingers. (DrawAI re-renders+revalidates every attempt; this is
   the lean analogue.)
   **MANDATORY trace (enforced by the gate).** For every image-model figure, run **≥2 rounds** and write
   each round's observed diff to `figures/repair_logs/<label>.log` (≥1 line; **never empty**). An empty or
   missing `repair_logs/<label>.log` for an image-model figure is a **stage-6 failure** —
   `run_gates.py <workdir> all` runs `check_figure_critique`, which fails on an empty trace,
   `critic_rounds < 2`, or missing grounding manifest fields. This is the fix for the historical
   "critique loop never ran / empty repair_logs" regression.
   **"Accept" here means the PNG is approved and ready to vectorize (step 5b)** — not yet inserted.
5b. **Redraw as a native SVG — hand off to `ts-figure-svg` (image-model figures only).** The approved PNG
   is the **design target**, not the figure. Invoke the sibling skill **`ts-figure-svg`** (read its SKILL.md
   and `references/svg-craft.md`): it extracts the render's **design language** into `<label>.style.json`,
   redraws the figure **from the paper's own facts** as real `<rect>/<path>/<text>` objects, and runs a
   measured repair loop until clean:
   ```
   python3 ../ts-figure-svg/scripts/audit_svg.py <work>/round_0N.svg --json <work>/round_0N.audit.json
   python3 ../ts-figure-optimize/scripts/render_svg.py <work>/round_0N.svg <work>/round_0N.png --width 1440
   python3 ../ts-figure-optimize/scripts/render_svg.py <work>/round_0N.svg <work>/round_0N_col.png --width 480
   # clean -> figures/<label>.svg
   python3 ../ts-figure-svg/scripts/svg_to_pdf.py figures/<label>.svg figures/<label>.pdf
   ```
   **≥4 rounds is the floor, with no upper bound while defects remain**, and the audit must PASS — that is
   the contract `run_gates.check_figure_critique` enforces via `svg_rounds` + the audit JSON. `audit_svg.py`
   is stdlib-only (Times core-14 metrics, no renderer needed), so this path has no provisioning step.
   - **NEVER trace the pixels.** Auto-vectorising the PNG yields tens of thousands of paths that are still
     blurry when zoomed and editable by nobody. "No `<image>` element" ≠ vector.
   - **NEVER take the render's logic.** Generated figures invent sequential links, fabricate numbers and
     garble labels. Style from the PNG, content from the paper — re-verify every edge and symbol.
   - **Simplify freely, but only texture and ornament** — never a branch, constraint, symbol or evidence
     boundary.
   **If the redraw genuinely cannot converge** (or you want the render kept pixel-exact instead), fall back
   to `ts-figure-optimize`'s DrawAI **HYBRID** — the approved render kept exact with an editable `<text>`
   overlay (`setup_drawai.py --device gpu`, then `run_hybrid.py --no-text-gpt` + `export_paper_figure.py`);
   and if that is unprovisionable too, **KEEP the approved `figures/<label>.png` as-is** and log it. Do NOT
   degrade to a flat boxes-and-arrows diagram — `check_figure_critique` blocks any free-form figure that
   isn't a real `image-model`/`paperbanana` render (the carbon-paper regression).

   Then **lint** via ts-figure-optimize's gate (the suite's figure check):
   `python ../ts-figure-optimize/scripts/check_vector_pdf.py lint --svg figures/<label>.svg --type <type> --render-check`.
   A native redraw passes on its live `<text>`; a **hybrid** passes when its labels stayed editable `<text>`
   over the render (the whole-canvas raster is expected there). The gate fails only a **textless raster** (a
   bare screenshot) or an editability-breaking element. (A kept PNG has no `.svg` to lint — allowed by the
   DoD check as "unconverted, PNG kept".) (matplotlib figures skip 5b — born-vector from `finalize`.)
6. **Insert + record.** Replace the placeholder `\fbox{\rule…}` (only that token) with the
   **extension-less** `\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/<label>}` — keep the existing
   `\caption`/`\label`; use `\textwidth` for a wide (`figure*`) float. Extension-less so pdflatex embeds
   the vector `figures/<label>.pdf` (and falls back to the kept `.png` if a `.pdf` is ever missing). Then
   **append this figure to `figures/figures.manifest.json`** — for an **image-model** figure record
   `{"label","type","engine":"image-model"|"paperbanana","reference_used":"<arxiv>#fig<n>",`
   `"grounding":"image-cond"|"vision-distill","critic_rounds":<int ≥ 2>}`, plus — when step 5b redrew it —
   `"svg_redraw":true,"svg_rounds":<int ≥ 4>,"svg_audit":"figures/audit_logs/<label>.audit.json"` — for a SCHEMATIC type the
   `reference_used`/`grounding` must be REAL (the gate FAILS `"none"`); only a `qualitative` scene may be `"none"`. A **matplotlib** figure
   records `{"label","type","engine":"matplotlib"}`.
   — so the DoD gate knows each figure's type: `run_gates.py all` calls `check_vector_pdf.py check`, which
   asserts every figure has an embedded artifact and that every **converted** figure's `.svg` is a **valid
   hybrid** (editable `<text>` over the render) — an unconverted figure that kept its PNG is allowed; and
   `check_figure_critique`, which asserts every image-model figure has a non-empty `repair_logs/<label>.log`,
   `critic_rounds ≥ 2`, and the `grounding`/`reference_used` fields (this is what blocks a flat hand-draw).

## Placeholder format (emitted by the write stage)
```latex
\begin{figure}[htb]\centering
%% FIGURE-SPEC type=architecture
%% DESC: one concise line — the exact boxes, arrows, and data flow, in the paper's own terms
\fbox{\rule{0pt}{3cm}\rule{0.9\columnwidth}{0pt}}
\caption{...}\label{fig:...}\end{figure}
```
`type` renderable: `{architecture, pipeline, framework, concept, schematic, overview, qualitative, diagram, flow}`;
skip-it: `{results, plot, curve, bar, chart}`. A legacy bare placeholder (no spec) still works — classify
it from the caption + context in step 1. The placeholder/FIGURE-SPEC is **unchanged** by vectorization —
the write stage emits the same `\fbox{\rule…}` token; only the inserted target is now an editable
vector PDF (step 6).

## Compile fit
Figures land in `<workdir>/figures/<label>.pdf` (the embedded vector) with `<label>.png` + the source
(`.plot.py` / `.svg`) kept alongside; `assemble_paper.py` compiles in `<workdir>` and the bundled
`.sty` already `\RequirePackage{graphicx}`, so the extension-less `\includegraphics{figures/<label>}`
resolves the `.pdf` (vector preferred over `.png` under pdflatex) with no extra wiring — and no
`\includesvg`/Inkscape dependency (cairosvg pre-renders SVG→PDF). If you re-run write/refine/review,
re-run this stage.

## Trace
Write `logs/6_figure.io.md` — INPUT (placeholders found: label / type / caption), DECISIONS (per figure:
SKIP+why, or **the GROUND reference chosen** (paper id + figure no + venue, or `none` + why) and the
`grounding` mode (`image-cond`/`vision-distill`/`none`), the final prompt + the per-figure critic round
count (also mirrored line-by-line in `figures/repair_logs/<label>.log`) + **the OBSERVED diff each render
round made** (not the requested edit — and never claim a round that produced a byte-identical render); for
method/architecture figures the **symbol→defining-module edge list** and the per-symbol semantic-
faithfulness verdict; **and the vectorize outcome** — branch = matplotlib born-vector vs **native SVG
redraw** (ts-figure-svg: round count + the final audit's error/warning counts) vs HYBRID (editable text
over the render) vs PNG-kept, with a one-line note), OUTPUT
(per figure the artifact set — `figures/<label>.pdf` (embedded vector) +
`.png` (kept) + source (`.plot.py` / `.svg`) — which `.tex` was edited, and the `figures.manifest.json`
entry). The kept `figures/<label>.prompt.txt` files are part of the trace.
