# Final Submission Checklist

Mandatory gate (SKILL Step 13), run before the final commit/push. Output:
`./outputs/reports/FINAL_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`. If an item fails, fix it in `./paper/` or flag
it to the user.

- [ ] Author names are **not placeholder** (no "Anonymous", "John Doe", "TODO").
- [ ] Affiliations are **not placeholder**.
- [ ] Corresponding email is **not placeholder**.
- [ ] DOI placeholder handled (real DOI, or clearly marked as "to be assigned").

**References**

- [ ] References **complete and verified** (see `reference_verification.md`).
- [ ] **No title-only references** (each has authors, venue, year as appropriate).

**Figures / tables**

- [ ] Figures **readable**.
- [ ] Tables **readable**.
- [ ] Table/figure **numbering correct** and sequential.

**Claims / integrity**
